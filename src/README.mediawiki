===Questions===

<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why create this progrm, instead of porting the application you made?</dt>
<dd>
<p>While I would like to port over the application itself, which should not take much work, due to this program utilizing a library I made that can read and write bcheck files, it does not seem feasible at this time.</p>
<p>Also, since bcheck files are just JSON files with a different extension, it is possible to pretty much do everything in a text editor, so no real dedicated editor is needed for any platform.</p>
<p>This program was mainly design to only be a reader, so that Windows and Linux users can read their save files from the iOS application, and get details of their current balance.</p>
